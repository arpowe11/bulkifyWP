**NEW NAME FOR PROJECT:** "BulkifyWP"


**Project Description:**
Developed an automation solution to streamline the creation of WordPress e-commerce products for a client managing hundreds of grouped photos. The challenge involved handling photo sets where each group shared a common naming convention with unique numerical identifiers and required individual product listings on the website.

The software accepted key inputs, including the base photo name, group price, and the number of photos in each group. It generated a CSV file formatted for WordPress import, enabling the client to bulk upload and create dozens of products instantly. This solution boosted productivity by 92%, eliminating the need for manual product creation and significantly reducing time and effort while ensuring accuracy and consistency across the listings.
